# Integrate Frontend and Backend for Upload Workflow

Connect the frontend upload UI to the backend upload endpoint, ensuring seamless user experience and robust error handling throughout the workflow.

Goals:
- Enable end-to-end PDF upload from frontend to backend, with real-time feedback.
- Ensure all edge cases (file too large, wrong type, storage failure) are handled gracefully and communicated to the user.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Successful uploads result in document ID and status being displayed or used for further processing.
- All error cases are surfaced to the user with clear, actionable messages.
- Uploaded PDFs are accessible for review and further processing.

Technical Details:
- Architecture/Module Changes: Update frontend to call backend endpoint and handle responses.
- Interfaces and Types: Ensure request/response types are consistent between frontend and backend.
- Integration Points: Frontend upload component calls backend upload endpoint; backend returns document ID/status or error.
- Side Effects/Dependencies: None beyond core upload workflow.
- Examples/Conventions: Follow existing integration and error-handling patterns.
- Testing: Include integration tests for successful and failed uploads, including edge cases.
