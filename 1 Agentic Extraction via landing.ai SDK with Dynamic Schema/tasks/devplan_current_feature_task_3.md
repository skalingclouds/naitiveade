# Dynamic Pydantic Schema Generation and Extraction Backend

Implement backend logic to generate a Pydantic schema at runtime based on user-selected fields, call the landing.ai SDK extract endpoint with the schema, and store validated results.

Goals:
- Dynamically generate a schema matching user-selected fields and validate extracted data.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Backend receives user-selected fields and generates a Pydantic schema at runtime.
- Calls landing.ai SDK extract endpoint with schema.
- Validates extracted data against schema.
- Stores validated extraction results in persistent, secure storage.
- Handles schema or extraction errors gracefully.

Technical Details:
- Architecture/Module Changes: Add logic for dynamic schema generation and extraction orchestration.
- Interfaces and Types: Define mapping from field selection to Pydantic schema fields.
- Integration Points: Connect to landing.ai SDK extract endpoint and persistent storage/database.
- Database/Schema Changes: Ensure extracted data is stored securely and encrypted.
- Side Effects/Dependencies: Requires robust error handling for schema and extraction failures.
- Examples/Conventions: Follow backend conventions for dynamic model creation and validation.
- Testing: Include tests for schema generation, extraction, validation, and error cases.
