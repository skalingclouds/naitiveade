# Implement Chat Log Storage and Association with Documents

Implement logic to persist chat logs in SQLite, associating each chat message with its corresponding document. Ensure robust error handling and retry logic for storage failures.

Goals:
- Persist all chat interactions for each document.
- Ensure chat logs are reliably stored and retrievable.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Each chat message (query and response) is stored in SQLite with a reference to the document ID.
- On storage failure, the system retries once and notifies the user if it still fails.
- Chat logs can be retrieved for display or analytics.

Technical Details:
- Architecture/Module Changes: Extend backend data access layer to support chat log storage and retrieval.
- Interfaces and Types: Define chat log schema: { id, document_id, user_id, message, response, timestamp }
- Integration Points: Backend chat processing, analytics modules.
- Database/Schema Changes: Add chat_logs table with appropriate fields and foreign key to documents.
- Side Effects/Dependencies: Notify frontend on storage errors; ensure compliance with security/encryption requirements.
- Examples/Conventions: Follow existing database access and error handling patterns.
- Testing: Include tests for log storage, retrieval, retry logic, and error notification.
